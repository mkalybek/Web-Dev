            <strong>Nobody’s born smart.</strong> We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
            <em>Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike.</em> Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
            There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
            And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
            Thankfully, <em>we are born to learn.</em><br>
            Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
            <strong>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</strong><br>
            Until one day, you walk.<br>
            One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
            Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
            <strong>Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.</strong><br>
            <em>This. is. learning.</em><br>
            It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
            You just don’t get it, <strong>yet.</strong>
            Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
            are built on basic ideas that <strong>anyone, anywhere can understand.</strong><br>
            <strong>Whoever you are, wherever you are.</strong><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            You only have to know one thing:<br>
            <strong>You can learn anything.</strong>
